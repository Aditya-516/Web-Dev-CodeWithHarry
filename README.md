# Web Dev with CodeWithHarry 🚀

This repo contains my progress while following CodeWithHarry's Web Development course.  
I’m maintaining code + notes for each topic.

## 📂 Structure
- 01-html-basics → HTML tags, forms, tables
- 02-css-basics → Styling, Flexbox, Grid
- 03-js-basics → Variables, Functions, DOM
- 04-projects → Mini projects (To-Do List, Calculator)
- 05-advanced → Node.js, React, Fullstack apps

## 🏆 Goal
By the end of this course, I’ll build and deploy a **full-stack project** and use this repo as part of my portfolio.
